# Setupmac

This is a [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook to quickly setup
a Mac to how I like it.

If you already have ansible installed or prefer running it directly, execure the following :

```
ansible-playbook -i ./hosts playbook.yml --verbose
```

\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```
